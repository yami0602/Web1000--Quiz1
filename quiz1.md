# Quiz 1

1. Write a **recursive** function which receives an array and returns the sum of the elements of the array.


2.	Given two temperatures, return true if one is less than 0 and the other is greater than 100.  
    a.	icyHot(120, -1) → true  
    b.	icyHot(-1, 120) → true  
    c.	icyHot(2, 120) → false  

3.	Given 2 ints, a and b, return true if one if them is 10 or if their sum is 10.  
    a.	makes10(9, 10) → true  
    b.	makes10(9, 9) → false  
    c.	makes10(1, 9) → true  

4.	Given a string, take the first 2 chars and return the string with the 2 chars added at both the front and back, so "kitten" yields"kikittenki". If the string length is less than 2, use whatever chars are there.  
    a.	front22("kitten") → "kikittenki"  
    b.	front22("Ha") → "HaHaHa"  
    c.	front22("abc") → "ababcab"
